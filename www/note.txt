Things to do:

- Get Twitter updating to work with twitterhandler. Right now, it's not working because I'm getting a 500 ERROR. Once this is done the PHP should be able to be called like the weather. 
* Test if this will update by increasing update frequency.

- Do the same with schedule/config file update
*
